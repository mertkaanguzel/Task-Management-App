# Task Management App

This api has been built on **NestJS**. It communicates with **Postgre DB** through **TypeORM**. It allows a logged in member to create and manage their tasks. After creating a task, a member can change the status of it and delete it. Also, a member can list his/her own tasks with or without filters. The authentication and authorization strategy has been ensured using **Passport** and **JWT**. Lastly, unit testing of the api has been written using **JestJS**.
